    <h1>Sloop frequently-asked questions</h1>

    <dl class="faq">

      <dt>What formats does Sloop support?</dt>

      <dd>Sloop reads data collections in a simple format called
      <cite>Comma-Separated Values</cite> (CSV).  You can save CSV
      from any spreadsheet or database program, and you can also
      create CSV data collections using Google Docs.  For more
      information, see <a href="publishing.html">Publishing
      data</a>.</dd>

      <dt>How do I link to a different dataset?</dt>

      <dd>Sloop assumes that any field with a value that
      <em>looks</em> like a URL (with no extra text) actually is one.
      When the user taps the link, Sloop will check to see if the
      resource on the other end has a content type of "text/csv"; if
      so, it will try to load it as a data collection; otherwise, it
      will send it off to the Android browser (or some other app that
      can handle it).</dd>

      <dt>How can I publish CSV straight from a Google spreadsheet?</dt>
      <dd>Select "Share" for your spreadsheet and set its status to
      "Public on the web."  Then copy the sharing link and add
      "<code>output=csv&amp;</code>" immediately after the question
      mark.  For example, if the sharing link is
      "<code>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AoDV0i2WefMXdEI2VV9Xb1I5eFpBeS1HYkw5NGNqR3c&amp;usp=sharing</code>",
      you can get a CSV link by using
      <code>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?output=csv&amp;key=0AoDV0i2WefMXdEI2VV9Xb1I5eFpBeS1HYkw5NGNqR3c&amp;usp=sharing</code>.</dd>

      <dt>Why the name "Sloop"?</dt>

      <dd>Sloop is named after not the modern sailing sloop, but the
      <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloop-of-war">Sloop-of-war</a>
      from two centuries ago.  The Sloop was a fast ship-rigged
      (three-masted) vessel, smaller than a frigate or a ship of the
      line, but still capable of crossing the ocean.  The British
      Royal Navy often used sloops to carry dispatches quickly from
      point to point all over the world &mdash; it seemed like a nice
      analogy for a small, light data browser.</dd>
